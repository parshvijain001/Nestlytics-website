Nestlytics is a multi-page analytical web platform I developed during my internship with the Department of Forest and Wildlife, as part of an initiative to support the Delhi Bird Atlas project. The platform is designed to assist researchers and field officers in managing, analyzing, and visualizing species data with ease and precision.

Users can upload CSV datasets containing species names and their geocodes (longitude and latitude), and the platform automatically processes the data to generate comprehensive insights — including species density, population patterns, and interactive heatmaps. The visualizations can also be exported as standalone, downloadable HTML maps for reports and field documentation.

From a technical standpoint, Nestlytics integrates both frontend and backend scripting. The backend is built with Python, using frameworks and libraries like FastAPI, Pandas, and Folium for efficient data handling, geospatial computation, and map rendering. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, following a client-server model for seamless interaction between user input and server-side data processing.

By combining data analytics with web-based interactivity, Nestlytics provides an accessible, one-click tool for biodiversity monitoring — simplifying tasks like population tracking, survey management, and species density visualization.
